# Right Edge Alphavantage plugin
This is my Alphavantage plugin for RightEdge.
To use it you would want to first make yourself an account on https://www.alphavantage.co/.
Then second install RightEdge from http://www.rightedgesystems.com/ and add the dll to the pluggins folder. 
With this you could then download stock price data to RightEdge and back test trading systems on it. 

Adding a second file to this repo. SymbolConfig.cs 
This is a port to c# of the python code I use in Mechanizd to add symbols to the maxalpha symbolconfig file. 
Tested it works eactly one time. Ready to ship!
